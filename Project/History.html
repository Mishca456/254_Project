 <h2>Sunset Strip before the glamourization</h2> (right indent)
 <p>Prior to the 1984 incorporation of the city of West Hollywood, the Sunset Strip lay in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County. Because of this, the Sunset Strip and all of West Hollywood gained a reputation for being a loosely regulated area, in large part because it was not under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>

<section> <h3>1960's</h3>
<p>By the early 1960s, Sunset Strip had lost favor with the majority of movie people, but its restaurants, bars and clubs continued to serve as an attraction for locals and tourists. 
In the mid-1960s it became a major gathering place for the counterculture and was the scene of the Sunset Strip curfew riots in November 1966, involving police and crowds of young club-goers.The counterculture is a culture whose values and norms differ from mainstream society.
Those riots inspired the Buffalo Springfield song <q>For What It's Worth</q>. 
Sunset Strip became popular with rock musicians and their fans. 
Bands such as Led Zeppelin, the Doors, the Byrds, Love, the Seeds, Frank Zappa, and others played at clubs like Gazzarri's, the Whisky a Go Go, the Roxy, Pandora's Box and the London Fog.

Clubs on the Sunset Strip at that time, Rodney Bingenheimer's in particular, were notorious for allowing teenage patrons.
<q>Nobody carried or cared about ID's. Thirteen-year-old girls could walk in dressed like sexy 25-year-olds, and kids could saddle up to the bar and order a cocktail, so it wasn't a big stretch for us to get up and play there</q>, recalled Quiet Riot founder Kelly Garni.
The 1979 Donna Summer song <q>Sunset People</q>, from the album Bad Girls, was about the nightlife on Sunset Boulevard.
